     * Key names for common characters. These should be used with keyup/keydown
     * events, since the .keyCode property on those is meant to indicate the
     * *physical key* the user held down on the keyboard. Hence the mapping uses
     * only the unshifted version of each key (e.g. no '#', since that's shift+3).
     * Keypress events on the other hand generate (mostly) ASCII codes since they
     * correspond to *characters* the user typed.
     *

     * correct for non-US keyboard layouts.
