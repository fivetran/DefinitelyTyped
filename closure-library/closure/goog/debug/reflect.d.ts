     *     manage to determine it. Warning: in IE7 ActiveX (including DOM) objects
     *     don't expose their type to JavaScript. Their {@code constructor}
     *     property is undefined and they are not even the instances of the
     *     {@code Object} type. This method will recognize them as 'ActiveXObject'.
